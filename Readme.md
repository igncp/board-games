# Board Games

Implementation of popular board games specs.

No UI is provided, the structure is made flexible to support many integrations (REST server, direct imports, databases, etc.).

The purpose of this project is to try new ways of architecting complex business logic like a board game ruleset. Normally they will contain unit tests or scripts to run some parts of the functionality.
