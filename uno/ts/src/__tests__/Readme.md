# Unit / Integration tests

## Possible Testable Flows

### Implemented

### Not implemented

- A player uses a card, having only one left. The possibility for saying "Uno" is given, but it is not done, and another player points it out, so the player draws two cards
- **improve** - First cards: A draw-two or any of the two wild cards appear as the first one in the discard cards pile, producing the expected effect
